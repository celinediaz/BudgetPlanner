# Budget Planner

This is a simple CRUD app, using MySQLi, done for my intro to databases class.

I added docker-compose so it can be set up easily. Assuming you have Docker, clone this repo, position yourself in its directory with the terminal and run ```docker-compose up```. 

To use your own password and change the database name edit the [docker-compose.yml](../master/docker-compose.yml) file and the [conexion.php](../master/php/src/includes/conexion.php) file. 

I used the Daydream boostrap theme from [hackerthemes](https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-themes/).
